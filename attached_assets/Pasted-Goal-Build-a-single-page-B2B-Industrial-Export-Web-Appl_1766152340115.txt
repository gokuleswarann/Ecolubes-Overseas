Goal: Build a single-page B2B Industrial Export Web Application called "Ecolubes Overseas" using React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.

Tech Stack:

React (Vite)

Tailwind CSS (for styling)

Lucide React (for icons)

Google Gemini API (for AI features)

Core Features to Implement:

Global Configuration:
Create a constant COMPANY_CONFIG object to centrally manage:

Name: "Ecolubes Overseas"

Logo URL: "https://www.google.com/search?q=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Oil_Drop.svg/512px-Oil_Drop.svg.png"

Email: sales@ecolubesoverseas.com

Phone: +971 4 123 4567

Address: Business Bay, Dubai, UAE

Product Catalog (Mock Data):
Create a PRODUCTS array with these items (use high-quality industrial Unsplash/Wikimedia URLs for images):

Virgin Base Oil SN 150 (Golden oil image)

Virgin Base Oil SN 500 (Amber oil image)

Recycled Base Oil SN 150 (Industrial drums image)

Bitumen 60/70 (Dark asphalt image)

Fuel Oil CST 180 (Dark heavy oil image)

Industrial Solvents (Refinery image)

UI Components:

Navbar: Responsive, sticky, with a "Request Quote" counter.

Hero Section: Full-width background image (Industrial port), overlay text, "Export from Dubai to the World" badge.

Product Grid: distinct cards showing Image, Specs (tags), and an "Add to Quote" button.

Quote Sidebar (Cart): Slide-out drawer showing selected items. Instead of "Checkout", use a button "Proceed to Inquiry".

Contact Section: Detailed footer with MapPin, Phone, and Email icons.

AI Features (Requires Gemini API):

EcoBot Widget: A floating chat button in the bottom right. Opens a chat window where users can ask technical questions about oil specs. Use a system prompt: "You are an expert petrochemical consultant for Ecolubes."

Magic Email Drafter: In the Contact Form, add a button "✨ AI Draft". It should take the user's rough notes and generate a professional B2B inquiry letter using the LLM.

Technical Requirements:

Use fetch to call the Gemini API (https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-09-2025:generateContent).

Use process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY or Replit Secrets for the API Key.

Ensure the design is fully responsive (mobile-friendly).

Use specific Tailwind colors: bg-blue-900 for primary, text-yellow-500 for accents.
